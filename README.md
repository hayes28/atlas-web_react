## Objectives
- Learn the appropriate use cases for Class components versus functional components.
- Understand and implement lifecycle methods in Class components.
- Handle events within React components.
- Write unit tests for React components and utilize Jest spies to intercept function calls.
- Create and use HOCs to augment component behavior.
- Optimize component rendering with `shouldComponentUpdate` and pure components.

- Run tests with `npm test` to ensure component integrity.

## Features
- Transformation of functional components into Class components.
- Lifecycle methods such as `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount`.
- Custom `markAsRead` event handler within the Notifications component.
- Unit tests including tests for event handlers and lifecycle methods.
- WithLogging HOC for logging component mount/unmount events.
- Pure components for preventing unnecessary renders.

## Component Structure
- `App`: The main Class component converted from a functional component.
- `Notifications`: Class component with event handling and lifecycle methods.
- `BodySection` and `BodySectionWithMarginBottom`: Components demonstrating containment and specialization.
- `WithLogging`: An HOC for logging component lifecycle events.

## Testing Components
- Tests are written to ensure that components render correctly and respond to events as expected.
- Pure components and performance optimizations are tested to ensure they do not re-render unnecessarily.

# React Inline Styling Project
