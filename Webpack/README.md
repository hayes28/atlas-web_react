# Webpack Project

This project focuses on learning the key concepts of Webpack, a popular JavaScript module bundler. By completing this project, you will gain a solid understanding of how to set up Webpack for a basic project, handle entry points, outputs, and loaders, add plugins, split your code into chunks, and set up a development server.

## Resources

Before diving into the tasks, it's recommended to familiarize yourself with the following resources:

- [Webpack Documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/): Official documentation for Webpack.
- [Webpack Beginner Guide](https://www.sitepoint.com/webpack-beginner-guide/): A beginner's guide to Webpack.
- [npm-package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json): Documentation for the `package.json` file.

## Learning Objectives

1. How to set up Webpack for a basic project.
2. Understanding entry points, output, and loaders.
3. Adding plugins to enhance functionality.
4. Splitting code into manageable chunks.
5. Configuring and utilizing a development server for smoother development.

### Task 3: Dev Servers, Modules, and Tree Shaking

- Set up a development server using Webpack.
- Divide code into modules (header, body, footer).
- Configure Webpack for multiple entry points.
- Implement source mapping for improved debugging.
- Add a plugin to clean the build folder.
- Optimize bundles size by splitting modules.
